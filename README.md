# Sentiment Analysis with NLP

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for performing sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It covers data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions to classify text into sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

## Features

* **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a dataset of simulated reviews/tweets with pre-assigned sentiments.
* **Text Preprocessing (Simplified)**: Includes steps like tokenization (splitting by whitespace), lowercasing, and removing punctuation/numbers. (Note: This version does NOT use NLTK for stop word removal or lemmatization).
* **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
* **Machine Learning Model**: Trains a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes) to predict sentiment.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Prediction**: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict sentiment on new, unseen text.
* **Output Reports**: Generates text files showing sample predictions and a detailed model performance report.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-nlp.git
git clone    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-nlp.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-nlp
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repo name if it's different)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### How to Run

1.  **Generate the dataset:**
    This script creates `sentiment_data.csv` in the project root.
    ```bash
    python data_generator.py
    ```

2.  **Perform Sentiment Analysis (Preprocessing, Training, Evaluation, Prediction):**
    This script will load the data, preprocess it, train the sentiment model, evaluate its performance, save the model (`sentiment_model.pkl`), and generate output files: `sample_predictions.txt` and `model_report.txt`.
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analyzer.py
    ```

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Future Enhancements

* **Real Dataset**: Integrate with a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle, Twitter API, movie review datasets).
* **Advanced Models**: Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers like BERT) for sentiment analysis.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
* **Deployment**: Build a simple web application (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to allow users to input text and get instant sentiment predictions.
* **Visualization**: Add plots for sentiment distribution, word clouds for each sentiment, or model performance visualizations.
* **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment towards specific entities or aspects within the text.
